// background.js

//Heres a rundown of how background.js's Search Functionality Works
/**
 * 1. popup.js sends a message to backgroundjs, including the term to be searched
 * 2. background.js receives the message and handles it by doing something, in this case fetching the definition via fetchTermDefinition
 * 3. fetchTermDefinition makes a request to the server that handles our JSON database, when the server responds, fetchTermDefinition returns this data.
 * 4. fetchTermDefinition should also take care of any parsing/string manipulation, unless the server does that for us
 * 4. handleMessage takes the return value of fetchTermDefinition and sends it back to popup.js, which is tasked with putting the data on screen
 */


/**
 * 
 * @param {object {searchTerm: string}} request an object containing a search term and in the future any other information necessary (like filters/categories/specific standards org) to narrow the search
 * @param {Some odd Object thing} sender stuff relating to the original sender, popup.js
 * @param {Callback Func} sendResponse Sends a response back to the original message sender, in this case popup.js
 * @returns true to let chrome know the function is asynchronous
